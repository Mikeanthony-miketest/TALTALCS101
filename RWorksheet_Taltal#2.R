#WORKSHEET2 (MIKE ANTHONY TALTAL BSIT2A)
#1. Ceate a vector using : operator
#1a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output. Describe its output.
Num <- seq(-5,5)
Num
##[1] -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5

#1b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
#answer: The value of x is numbers form 1 to 7
q<- 1:7
q
##[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

#2. Create a vector using seq() function
#2a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.
Mike <- seq(1, 3, by= 0.2)

#a. Access 3rd element, what is the value?
Age[3]
##[1] 22

#b. Access 2nd and 4th element, what are the values?
Age[2]
##[1] 28
Age[4]
##[1] 36

#c. Access all but the 1st element is not included. Write the R code and its output.

#4.*Create a vector x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9). Then named the vector,names(x).
x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
names(x)
##[1] "first"  "second" "third" 

#a. Print the results. Then access x[c("first", "third")].Describe the output
x[c("first", "third")]
##Describe the output: the output in displays two lines
##on the first line it displays  first and third while on the second line it 
##displays 3 and 9.

#5 Create a sequence x from -3:2.
y <- c(-3:32)
y
#a. Modify 2nd element and change it to 0;
y[2] <- 0
y
##[1] -3  0 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
##[30] 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
##Describe the output: the -2 output was replaced by zero as a second element.

#6.*The following data shows the diesel fuel purchased by Mr. Cruz.
#a. Create a data frame for month, price per liter (php) and purchase-quantity (liter).
#Write the codes.
Month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "March", "Apr", "May", "June")

Quantity <- c(25, 30, 40, 50, 10, 45)  
data_frame <- data.frame(Month, Price, Quantity)

#b. What is the average fuel expenditure of Mr. Cruz from Jan to June? Note: Use
#weighted.mean(liter, purchase)

weighted.mean(Price,Quantity)
##[1] 59.2625
